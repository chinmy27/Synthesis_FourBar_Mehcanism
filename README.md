# Synthesis_FourBar_Mehcanism

Four Bar mechanism was synthesised by two methods here, both had different set of Inputs.

1. Bloch's Method - Inpurts are more like Constraints or Requirements. We design the Mechanism in this case with the required angluar Velocity and accelerations at each joint.

2. Freudenstein's Equation - Here the Inputs are the Input and Output Angles , Initial Condition. Chebyshev Spacing is also performed.
